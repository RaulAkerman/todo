Course 1, TODO app


    You will create an app that will store TODO's, these TODO's should contain a title and a body.
    
    The user should be able to open the site and have an option to create a new TODO and they should also be able to see all of their TODO's sorted by the order they were created, 
    
    the most recent coming first
    
    The design is up to you, show whatever information you think is useful in any way you want. The required data at minimum needs to be the title, description and the date the TODO 
    was created
    
    The user should be able to edit a TODO and also delete a TODO
    
    You can use any language or framework you want for either the frontend or the backend.
    
    The frontend requirements are this app should be a SPA, there should be no page reloads when adding or deleting a TODO
    
    The backend should be a REST API


Extra credit optional items, any can be chosen, or all
    
1. Multiple users, a user can create an account and be able to view their own created TODO's while not being able to view others users TODO's
2. Deleted TODO's aren't deleted from the system but are rather marked as completed so a user can see all their completed TODO's
3. Setting a deadline for a TODO, the user should be able to set a deadline for the TODO sometime in the future and the app should show the time to that deadline, ex. 1 day until due, 5 minutes until due
4. Setting groups for TODO's, the user should be able assign the TODO to a "group" that the user can then filter by and see all TODO's relating to that group
5. Dark/Light theme for the frontend
6. Mobile support for the frontend
7. Dockerized app, we can deploy this to the cum enterprises server easily
